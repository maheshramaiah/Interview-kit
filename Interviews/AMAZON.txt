*******************************

1. Migration from backbone to react

	Motivation

	1. Adapt to latest technology, better ways to build UI
	2. Achieve better web performance -> code splitting, css modules
	3. Better state management
	4. Better debugging tools with react
	5. Improve developer experience - Faster builds, hot reloading
	6. Efficient way of testing

	Problems

	1. Tree shaking -> usage of AMD modules
	2. Larger webpack builds due to dynamic requires
	3. Hash routing 

2. State machine -> with SSE

3. Carousel performance -> requestAnimationFrame

4. Design system
	- better api for using react components
